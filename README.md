## Accessory Store with Bootstrap
-----------------------------------------------------

# What I used to prepare this site:
* I created a Navigation Bar. I added [Homepage](homepage.html), [About Us](about.html) and [Products](products.html) to this bar.
* A dropdown opens when you hover over the Products option.
* Products are opened in the form of dropdowns divided into categories.
* You can view all categories by selecting "[all accessories](products.html)".
* Or by selecting one of the categories opened with the dropdown, you can open the page you want to look specifically at.
* By clicking on the "[products](products.html)" link on the homepage, you can go to the products page.
* I showed my products with the card component along with the grid system using Bootstrap.
* On the pages where I show the [products](products.html), I used the card components within the grid system.
* I made the homepage with jumbotron comonenti and explained the content.
* I created an album with the Carousel component on the About Us page.
